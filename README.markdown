Orange Room Software Wordpress Theme
====================================

This theme is built on the html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress theme, which is in turn built on top of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) by Paul Irish and Divya Manian.

The layout is based on Bruce Lawson's [Designing a Blog with HTML5](http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/)

Instead of using only DIVs for content layout, it uses new HTML5 tags, including [header](http://html5doctor.com/the-header-element/), 
[footer](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_footer.asp), 
[nav](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_nav.asp), 
[article](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_article.asp), 
and [section](http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/).

I have also added a healthy dose of css3 without fixes for ie6 etc. - so while it should degrade ok no attempt has been made to emulate the full functionality using tools like [csspie](http://css3pie.com/). With the current readership of my site I feel there is little point going to the trouble as most users use recent webkit/firefox versions on linux/osx 

Please feel free to download, reuse and modify.
